## Abstract
This project explores accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) for simulating peptide folding. Various combinations of force fields and solvation models were analyzed for their ability to reproduce native-like conformations.

## Key Findings
- Helical peptides: All methods performed well.
- Î²-hairpins: ff14SB+OPC showed the best results.
- Intrinsically disordered peptides: ff99SB+OPC performed best.

## Methodology
- Simulated the folding behavior of 8 peptides.
- Evaluated 3 combinations of force fields and solvation models.
- Conducted multiple analyses, including:
  - Dihedral angle distributions.
  - Principal component analysis (PCA).
  - Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD).

## Tools and Technologies
- **AMBER**: For molecular dynamics simulations.
- **Python**: For data processing and visualization.
- **CPPTRAJ**: For trajectory analysis.

## Repository Contents
- `docs/`: Documentation related to the thesis.
- `scripts/`: Placeholder for any analysis scripts (optional).

## About the Author
This project is based on the thesis submitted to the University of Milan in 2019/2020 for the degree of Master of Science in Molecular Biotechnology and Bioinformatics.
